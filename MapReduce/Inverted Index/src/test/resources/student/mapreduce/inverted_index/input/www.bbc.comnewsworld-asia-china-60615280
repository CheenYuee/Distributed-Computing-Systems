Ukraine invasion Can China do more to stop Russia's war in Ukraine
A month ago Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared there was no limit to Beijing's newly strengthened relationship with Russia
He and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had met face-to-face in Beijing culminating in a joint document and then they went off to see the opening of the Winter Olympic Games Days after the Games ended Russia invaded Ukraine
China's government has neither condemned nor condoned the attack and has even refrained from calling it an invasion in the first place It has always said that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of others a core principle of its foreign policy
But earlier this week China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi signalled that it was ready to play a role in mediating a ceasefire State media here reported that Mr Wang reaffirmed China's unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and assured his counterpart of China's readiness to make every effort to end the war through diplomacy
China's government also recently expressed regret about the military action saying it was extremely concerned about the harm to civilians
China has also done one other thing of note Alongside India it was one of 34 nations that abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's invasion something analysts say has come as a surprise Many had expected China to vote alongside Russia
So is it a sign of a shift in China's policy
It is more likely a sign that China is trying to strike a balance between the principle of respecting Ukraine's sovereignty while recognising what it describes as the legitimate security concerns of Russia
